First created the tables for departments, dept_emp, dept_manager, employees, salaries, and then titles. 
From there imported each corresponding CSV file.
    These had to imported in a certain order starting with departments, then employees, then titles, then dept_emp, then dept_manager, and finally salaries. Otherwise the would not import.
Then to get the Data Analysis queries:
    --employee number, last name, first name, sex, salary 
    --first name, last name, hire date in 1986
    --department manager, department number, department name, employee number, last name, first name
    --department number for each employee with employee number, last name, first name, department name
    --first name, last name, sex of each employee who's first name is Hercules and last name begins with B
    --each employee in Sales, with their employee number, last name and first name
    --each employee in Sales and Development with employee number, last name, first name and department name
    --frequency in counts, in descending order, of all employee last names
With this challenge I got help in office hours and from a classmate(Mackenzie Deets).
I also used ChatGPT to help clean my code.
